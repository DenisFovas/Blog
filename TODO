    Maybe use postgre sql? Or maria db?
    From the Github repo, maybe I shall stay with Postgre SQL, because it's node js 
    package it's more often updated.
    some links are [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9205496/how-to-make-connection-to-postgres-via-node-js)
    and [here](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres) and [here](http://mherman.org/blog/2015/02/12/postgresql-and-nodejs/)
    Now I will use sqlite3, more exemples online and better support from the community
