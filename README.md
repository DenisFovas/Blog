# Personal Blog

## Why make a blog from scratch when you can use something already that generate one?

I want to make one because I want to learn. That's why.

## Stuff I use

* express.js for the back end stuff
* Angular/Vue for the front
  * I need to think which one I will stick with
* PostgreSQL for the database
  * Maybe I will change it
